Title: Bearer Token Authentication - FastMCP

You can configure your FastMCP client to use **bearer authentication** by supplying a valid access token. This is most appropriate for service accounts, long-lived API keys, CI/CD, applications where authentication is managed separately, or other non-interactive authentication methods.A Bearer token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is used to authenticate a request. It is most commonly used in the `Authorization` header of an HTTP request, using the `Bearer` scheme:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Client Usage
------------

The most straightforward way to use a pre-existing Bearer token is to provide it as a string to the `auth` parameter of the `fastmcp.Client` or transport instance. FastMCP will automatically format it correctly for the `Authorization` header and bearer scheme.

```
from fastmcp import Client

async with Client(
    "https://fastmcp.cloud/mcp", 
    auth="<your-token>",
) as client:
    await client.ping()
```

You can also supply a Bearer token to a transport instance, such as `StreamableHttpTransport` or `SSETransport`:

```
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import StreamableHttpTransport

transport = StreamableHttpTransport(
    "http://fastmcp.cloud/mcp", 
    auth="<your-token>",
)

async with Client(transport) as client:
    await client.ping()
```

`BearerAuth` Helper
-------------------

If you prefer to be more explicit and not rely on FastMCP to transform your string token, you can use the `BearerAuth` class yourself, which implements the `httpx.Auth` interface.

```
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.auth import BearerAuth

async with Client(
    "https://fastmcp.cloud/mcp", 
    auth=BearerAuth(token="<your-token>"),
) as client:
    await client.ping()
```

If the MCP server expects a custom header or token scheme, you can manually set the client’s `headers` instead of using the `auth` parameter by setting them on your transport:

```
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import StreamableHttpTransport

async with Client(
    transport=StreamableHttpTransport(
        "https://fastmcp.cloud/mcp", 
        headers={"X-API-Key": "<your-token>"},
    ),
) as client:
    await client.ping()
```
