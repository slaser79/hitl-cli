You have a two fold goal.

The support of the static OAUTH client will be removed in the CLI client.
All agents will use dynamic client registration router via the MCP server.

Remove code paths related to static oauth client registration + tests.
When logging no longer need to pass --dynamic as that will now be default

2) Ensure all tests pass (there are already mainy failing tests).

There is a first pass guide on resolving the issues, take those with a
pinch of salt and make your own assessment.

#Constraint and Tips

* Ensure to update any relevant documentation
* All tests should pass (Focus on behavioural testing)
